LA3: Abstrakte Vektorräume, auch mit anderen Körppern als R
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- start with R^3
    - keep some properties, remove others
    - gain a more abstract view on vectors
    - most conclusions still valid because they depend only on the properties we kept
    (concept: go through all properties, let the user find which ones are true for R^3,
        state basic idea for which properties we keep, then then list which ones we keep)
        - basic idea: detach from R^n, but keep the "rules"
    - for now state rules that can be derived from others, such as 0*v = s*0 = 0
- properties of R^n
    - selecting an element
        - depends on R^n
        - with different interpretations, it does not
            - coordinates according to a basis
            - orthogonal projection
        --> both will be defined later; can be derived from other properties
    - properties of addition
        - associativity
        - commutativity
        - identity element: zero vector
        - inverse element: negative vector
        - "subtraction" -- not really a rule but a definition
    - properties of scalar multiplication
        - associativity ("Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication")
        - "commutativity" -- not really a rule but a definition
    - combined properties
        - distributivity (both sides)
        - identity element: 1
        - 0*v = s*0 = 0
            - can be derived
        - (-1)v = -v
            - can be derived
        - sv=0 ==> s=0 or v=0
            - can be derived
    - length
        can be defined from scalar product
        -> triangle inequality
    - scalar product
        - the definition of the SP as we know it depends on R^n. Again we'll try to find the rules that govern the SP,
            then define the SP through these rules without reference to R^n.
        - commutativity
        - bilinearity
        - positive definiteness
        - Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: can be derived
        - scalar product is very important, but a vector space is interesting without it. So we consider the SP
            an "upgrade" to the vector space. Terminology: A "vector space with scalar product" has an SP;
            a "vector space" does not.
- abstract vector space
    - take the above properties as axioms, except those that can be derived
    - the "SP upgrade" is left out for now -- will be added later
    - axioms
        (list)
    - convenience definitions: v-w, v*s
    Übung:
    - Ist die folgende Menge/Regeln ein Vektorraum?
        (mehrere Beispiele)
- derive some missing properties from the axioms
    (braucht kaum text)
    Übungen:
    - 0*v = s*0 = 0
    - (-1)v = -v
