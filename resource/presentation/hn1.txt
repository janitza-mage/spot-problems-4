A collection of STEM problems with spaced repetition

I built a collection of STEM problems as a web app that presents the problems with spaced repetition. I felt that
exercises are neglected in uni courses, and even Khan Academy does not seem to give them the love they deserve.
(??? is this true about KA? tried basic level, what about college level?)

I first wanted to build a fully guided "practical exercise system" but realized that multiple issues are unsolved.
First, the selection and scheduling of problems is very different based on the reason someone is using such an app.
Second, automated grading is really hard at college/university level. I chose to build a passive collection of
problems instead, because any fully guided system will need such a collection anyway, and this allows others to
attempt different approaches to such a system without having to collect problems first.
