basic logic components (not, and, or, nand, nor, N-(n)(and/or))
    truth tables
    implement using each other
    more complex combinations -> truth tables
    more complex combinations -> reduce to simple
    mux

boolean logic formulas
    describe basic elements
    vs truth tables
    rules (de morgan, distributivity)

logic delays
    single-gate delay
    parallel delay
    serial delay
    glitches
    shortest path
    longest path
    inverter ring
    biased inverter ring, duty cycle

storage components
    D-latch
    clock signals
    disadv. pass through multiple stages
    D-flipflop
    SR latch
    SR latches and glitches

CMOS
    n-type and p-type MOSFETs
    switching 0s and 1s with 0s and 1s
    inverter / not gate
    NAND / NOR gates
    AND / OR gates; "built-in inversion"
    complex gates
    mux
    latch
    flipflop
    transmission gate
    buffer

...

bidirectional buses
    ...

clock domains
    meta-stability
    synchronizers
