    meaning of "q.e.d."

sets
    definition
    finite sets
    comprehension
    tuples, cartesian product
    ...
    problem: Let the set A consist of the youths of a given group, and the set B o f the girls of the same group. Find A\JB, AO B, A\B . Also,
    consider the case when A or B is an empty set. "find" -> "what is the meaning of"
